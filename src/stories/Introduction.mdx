# Introduction
This is StackOverflow Tags Browser components documentation. Each component has its own story, which you can find in the sidebar. I used shadcn/ui componnents library, that uses Radix UI components.

## Structure

* **Introduction** - Contains general information about the project
* **Colors** - Contains all colors used in the project
* **Border Radius** - Contains all border radiuses used in the project
* **My Components** - Contains all components created by me
* **shadcn** - Contains all components imported from shadcn library

## Dark Mode switcher
You can switch between light and dark mode using the switcher located in the toolbar.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to make it work with components showcased in the docs. It works when previewing each individual story.
